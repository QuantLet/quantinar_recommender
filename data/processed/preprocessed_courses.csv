Financial Risk Meter for Emerging Markets,https://quantinar.com/course/52/FRM@EM,"The fast-growing Emerging Market (EM) economies and their improved transparency

and liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the external

price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as domestic policy instability.

Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging strategies are needed to help

investors protect their investments against this risk. In this paper, the daily systemic

risk measure FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is proposed for Emerging markets (FRM@

EM). The FRM@ EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior embedded in the

returns of the 25 largest EMs’ Financial Institutions (FIs), covering the BRIMST

(Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the

financial linkages between these economies. The results indicated that the FRM of

EMs’ FIs reached its maximum during the US financial crisis following the COVID-

19 crisis and the Macro factors explain the BRIMST’ FIs with various degrees of

sensibility. We then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event

network behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors choose

the tail-event optimized portfolios and the suitable market for investment. For that

purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies and FRM

network centrality is developed. We propose a robust and well-diversified tail-event

and cluster risk-sensitive portfolio allocation model named uplifted Hierarchical Risk

Parity (upHRP) and compare it to more classical approaches. Results indicate that

the upHRP approach provides better diversification. Moreover, the upHRP portfolio

overweight low-central FIs and underweight high-central ones.",7th November 2022,Souhir Ben Amor,18,fastgrowing emerging market em economy improved transparency liquidity attracted international investor however external price shock result higher level volatility well domestic policy instability therefore efficient risk measure hedging strategy needed help investor protect investment risk paper daily systemic risk measure frm financial risk meter proposed emerging market frm em frm em applied capture systemic risk behavior embedded return largest em financial institution fis covering brimst brazil russia india mexico south africa turkey thereby reflects financial linkage economy result indicated frm em fis reached maximum u financial crisis following covid crisis macro factor explain brimst fis various degree sensibility study relationship factor tail event network behavior build policy recommendation help investor choose tailevent optimized portfolio suitable market investment purpose overlapping region portfolio optimization strategy frm network centrality developed propose robust welldiversified tailevent cluster risksensitive portfolio allocation model named uplifted hierarchical risk parity uphrp compare classical approach result indicate uphrp approach provides better diversification moreover uphrp portfolio overweight lowcentral fis underweight highcentral one

Welcome & Introduction,https://quantinar.com/course/255/welcome-introduction,"_""Data is the new oil...""_

You might have heard this saying or a similar phrase before. Big Data, Analytics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, ... many _colorful_ terms refer to the increasing use of analytical models that aim at extracting insight from the vast amounts of data that the digital society is producing.

The module Business Analytics and Data Science (BADS) is concerned with theories, concepts, and practices to **support decision-making by means of formal, data-driven methods**. We will revisit different forms of model-based decision support, examine the standard workflow of modern data analysis, and discuss a broad set of models for descriptive and predictive analytics. **Predictive analytics** is the main focus of the course. Many corporate use cases of analytics and data science involve predicting some future state or behavior, for example, how customers will respond to certain marketing stimuli. We will introduce statistical principles of learning from data and cover several common prediction methods, ranging **from** established **industry workhorses like logistic regression** **to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms** such as gradient boosting. Subsequently, we will dive into specific tasks in the predictive modeling pipeline such as e.g., feature selection or remedies to the class imbalance problem. Given a variety of specialized modeling tasks and challenges, we will focus on topics with high relevance to managerial decision-making including cost-sensitive learning and model explainability (i.e., XAI).

The module consists of a lecture and a tutorial session. The **lecture** **introduces** relevant **concepts** and provides room for discussion. The goal of the **tutorial** is to empower students to develop state-of-the-art analytical models using contemporary programming libraries for data science. Specifically, we will use the **Python** programming language. Students receive demos on how to implement specific algorithms from scratch and work with real-world data to solve common modeling tasks themselves.

In summary, the module pursues the following **learning objectives**:

*   Students are familiar with the three branches of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics and appreciate the relationships between these streams.
*   Given some data, students are able to select appropriate techniques to summarize and visualize the data to maximize managerial insight.
*   Students understand the potential and also limitations of predictive analytics to aid decision-making. Given a decision task, they can discuss the relative merits and demerits of alternative algorithms and recommend a suitable prediction method.
*   Students are familiar with Python programming and standard Python libraries for data handling and machine learning. Using these tools, they can develop basic and advanced prediction models and assess their accuracy in a statistically sound manner.

It is not strictly necessary that students join the course with prior experience in computer programming. We reserve the first two weeks of the tutorial to introduce programming principles and the Python programming language. That said, **high and continuous engagement with the module** in general and the tutorial in particular **including ample time for self-study is expected to ensure the completion of our ambitious learning program**. Students who wish to prepare for the course are invited to complete some of the many excellent tutorials on Python programming. A simple web search for ""Python programming introduction"" produces tons of results. The resources at [Python.org also provide an excellent starting point.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)

"Bahadur, Edgeworth, Cornish-Fisher expansions",https://quantinar.com/course/647/bahadur-edgeworth-cornish-fisher-expansions,"In this course, we will study three important asymptotic expansions that improve upon the normal distribution approximation provided by the central limit theorem - the Bahadur, Edgeworth, and Cornish-Fisher expansions. A key focus will be using these expansions for estimating quantiles, which are widely used on risk measures.

The central limit theorem shows the distribution of sample statistics converges to normal, but the approximation can be poor for small samples or non-normal distributions. The expansions we study address this by incorporating higher order terms and cumulants.

The Bahadur expansion provides an approximation for sample quantiles using an asymptotic expansion incorporating higher order terms related to sample size. The Edgeworth expansion expands the cumulative distribution function itself using cumulants. The Cornish-Fisher expansion directly approximates the quantile function by adjusting the normal quantiles based on skewness and kurtosis.

In this course, we will derivate, compare, and apply these expansions for better understanding the quantile estimation. Students will have strong conceptual and practical skills for using asymptotic theory. The techniques will be broadly applicable across statistics and data science.",1st November 2023,Ruting Wang,9,course study three important asymptotic expansion improve upon normal distribution approximation provided central limit theorem bahadur edgeworth cornishfisher expansion key focus using expansion estimating quantiles widely used risk measure central limit theorem show distribution sample statistic converges normal approximation poor small sample nonnormal distribution expansion study address incorporating higher order term cumulants bahadur expansion provides approximation sample quantiles using asymptotic expansion incorporating higher order term related sample size edgeworth expansion expands cumulative distribution function using cumulants cornishfisher expansion directly approximates quantile function adjusting normal quantiles based skewness kurtosis course derivate compare apply expansion better understanding quantile estimation student strong conceptual practical skill using asymptotic theory technique broadly applicable across statistic data science
Sampling Bias and Scorecard Evaluation,https://quantinar.com/course/655/sampling-bias-and-scorecard-evaluation,"We revisit the problem of sample selection bias in application scoring. Unlike most prior research, our focus is not on how sampling bias impacts the development of credit scorecards. Instead, we study how using a biased sample (i.e., containing only accepted credit applicants) impacts the evaluation of scorecards. We demonstrate that standard practices for scorecard evaluation underestimate the true bad rate substantially. More importantly, we propose a Bayesian evaluation framework to mitigate the adverse effect of the sampling bias on scorecard evaluation. Our framework is agnostic of the employed measure of scorecard performance and supports a range of standard indicators including, but not limited to, the AUC, KS, the Brier score as well as any measure derived from the confusion matrix like precision, recall, or F-score. 

Extensive empirical experiments using synthetic and real-world microlending data provide strong evidence that our Bayesian framework predicts the true performance of a scorecard in production much better than standard practices and benchmarks taken from the literature. 

Last, we propose an approach to shed light on the business value of better practices for scorecard performance prediction. Considering a setting in which an institution aims to optimize its acceptance policy and seeks to determine the profit-maximizing acceptance rate, we find that Bayesian evaluation outperforms alternative approaches with notable margin across a wide range of LGDs. For example, assuming an average loan amount of $375 and an average LGD of 50% (based on our microlending data), we show that the incremental profit of Bayesian evaluation over the baseline of using only data from accepted clients is roughly $30 per loan. This significant increase in profit stems from the fact that Bayesian evaluation recommends a better (i.e., more profitable) acceptance rate.",6th September 2023,Stefan Lessmann,9,revisit problem sample selection bias application scoring unlike prior research focus sampling bias impact development credit scorecard instead study using biased sample ie containing accepted credit applicant impact evaluation scorecard demonstrate standard practice scorecard evaluation underestimate true bad rate substantially importantly propose bayesian evaluation framework mitigate adverse effect sampling bias scorecard evaluation framework agnostic employed measure scorecard performance support range standard indicator including limited auc k brier score well measure derived confusion matrix like precision recall fscore extensive empirical experiment using synthetic realworld microlending data provide strong evidence bayesian framework predicts true performance scorecard production much better standard practice benchmark taken literature last propose approach shed light business value better practice scorecard performance prediction considering setting institution aim optimize acceptance policy seek determine profitmaximizing acceptance rate find bayesian evaluation outperforms alternative approach notable margin across wide range lgds example assuming average loan amount average lgd based microlending data show incremental profit bayesian evaluation baseline using data accepted client roughly per loan significant increase profit stem fact bayesian evaluation recommends better ie profitable acceptance rate

Assessing the Quality of Human-Generated Summaries with Weakly Supervised Learning,https://quantinar.com/course/44/summaryQuality,"This paper explores how to automatically measure the quality of human-generated summaries, based on a Norwegian corpus of real estate condition reports and their corresponding summaries. The proposed approach proceeds in two steps. First, the real estate reports and their associated summaries are automatically labelled using a set of heuristic rules gathered from human experts and aggregated using weak supervision. The aggregated labels are then employed to learn a neural model that takes a document and its summary as inputs and outputs a score reflecting the predicted quality of the summary. The neural model maps the document and its summary to a shared ""summary content space"" and computes the cosine similarity between the two document embeddings to predict the final summary quality score. The best performance is achieved by a CNN-based model with an accuracy (measured against the aggregated labels obtained via weak supervision) of 89.5%, compared to 72.6% for the best unsupervised model. Manual inspection of examples indicate that the weak supervision labels do capture important indicators of summary quality, but the correlation of those labels with human judgements remains to be validated. Our models of summary quality predict that approximately 30% of the real estate reports in the corpus have a summary of poor quality.",7th November 2022,Arild Næss,8,paper explores automatically measure quality humangenerated summary based norwegian corpus real estate condition report corresponding summary proposed approach proceeds two step first real estate report associated summary automatically labelled using set heuristic rule gathered human expert aggregated using weak supervision aggregated label employed learn neural model take document summary input output score reflecting predicted quality summary neural model map document summary shared summary content space computes cosine similarity two document embeddings predict final summary quality score best performance achieved cnnbased model accuracy measured aggregated label obtained via weak supervision compared best unsupervised model manual inspection example indicate weak supervision label capture important indicator summary quality correlation label human judgement remains validated model summary quality predict approximately real estate report corpus summary poor quality

Robo-advising under rare disasters,https://quantinar.com/course/146/robo-advising-under-rare-disasters,"Robo-advisors provide investors with automated portfolio management services, and their growth is unprecedented. They performed less well during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had done during the non-crisis period. That less satisfactory performance was due to the fact that rare disasters are highly unlikely to occur and yet have a huge impact on financial markets.

To improve the performance and learning efficiency of robo-advising, we develop a novel learning framework to tackle rare disaster events. This framework integrates importance sampling with the reinforcement learning algorithm. Instead of sampling transition probability from a ground-truth probability distribution, we sample it from proposal distribution, where the event of interest occurs more frequently.

The proposed algorithm is validated by data covering both the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, showing superior performance over benchmarked methods. This is attributed to the intended learning about rare disasters so robo-advisors sharply lower the position on risky assets in advance.

FRM Financial Risk Meter,https://quantinar.com/course/171/frm-financial-risk-meter,"The concept of risk deals with the exposure to danger, in the world of finance the danger of financial losses. In a globalised financial economy, many risks are unknown. ""We know it when we see it"", to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart (1964). The Financial Risk Meter (FRM) sheds light on the emergence of systemic risk. Using of quantile regression techniques, it is a meter for financial risk, and its network topology offers insight into the spill-over effects risking systemic risk events. In this thesis, the FRM framework in various markets and regions is developed and the FRM data is used for risk now- and forecasting, and for portfolio optimization approaches. In Chapter 1 the FRM is presented and applied to equity markets in the US and Europe, but also interest rate and credit-default swap markets. The FRM is then used to now-cast and predict economic recessions. In Chapter 2 the FRM is applied to cryptocurrencies, to generate the first risk meter in this nascent asset class. The generated FRM data concerning dependencies, spill-over effects and network set-up are then used to create tail-risk optimised portfolios. In Chapter 3 the FRM is applied to the global market Emerging Market (EM) financial institutions. The FRM for EM gives specific spill-over dependencies in tail-risk events within sectors of financial institutions, but also shows inter-country dependencies between the EM regions. The FRM data is then combined with portfolio management approaches to create tail-risk sensitive portfolios of EM Financial institutions with aim to minimize risk clusters in a portfolio context.

On Crypto-backed Loans,https://quantinar.com/course/174/On-Crypto-backed-Loans,"Abstract

This paper introduces a mathematical model for the currently popular decentralised finance product, namely _crypto-backed peer-to-peer lending_ (CP2P). The model provides a potential justification of the positive interest rate premium charged by lenders from overly-collateralised loans. 

In the proposed model, the borrower’s payoff is rather exotic: a _perpetual American roll down call option with exponentially growing strikes and barriers_. The payoff can be seen as a variant of the _extended roll-down call option_ documented by Carr et al. (1999). From a borrower’s perspective, quantitative analysis is carried out to investigate the relationship among the _fair value_ of the loan (a term from the stock loans literature, see e.g. Xia and Zhou (2007), Cai and Sun (2014), Dai and Xu (2011) Etc.), variables in the loan terms, and the characteristics of the underlying price process.

\======================================================================

The development of distributed ledger technology renovates the form of lending and borrowing: borrowers and lenders can now transact without traditional intermediaries e.g. banks. Instead, the whole borrow process is performed and governed by pre-agreed, immutable protocols and applications deployed on blockchains. Financial services on blockchains, known as decentralised finance, are different from their traditional counterparts due to their anonymous and decentralised nature. One major difference is that every aspect in decentralised finance must be monetarily incentivised; CP2P is no exception. In fact, popular CP2P protocols, e.g. Compound, AAVE and dYdX, are built upon balancing the incentives of the parties involved. As of 15th of March 2022, the total value locked as collateral in the CP2P market is worth 73 billion USD (data from [https://www.defipulse.com/](https://www.defipulse.com/)
).

Lenders’ incentive to supply liquidity is relatively straightforward: earning interest payment from _overly-collateralised_ loans. In CP2P, collateral is always applied to financially bind borrowers to repay. Since collaterals are in volatile cryptocurrencies, CP2P protocols usually require borrowers to pledge collateral that is worth more than the borrowings, i.e. over-collateralising the loan. Over-collateralisation does not only take place at the inception of the loan; it is enforced throughout the whole loan period. Popular protocols have mechanisms to check the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) periodically. If the LTV is larger than a pre-defined threshold, protocols turn part of the borrower’s debt available for liquidation.

Liquidators are individuals who repay unhealthy debts and receive collateral. Anyone can be liquidators. Liquidators are incentivised by the liquidation bonus, the extra amount of collateral received during the liquidation, pre-agreed by borrowers.

The CP2P loan terms seem harsh to borrowers especially the over-collateralisation requirement, but borrowers are not totally at a disadvantage. Contrarily, CP2P helps borrowers to achieve a range of objectives. First, borrowers receive liquidity in preferred cryptocurrencies without selling their crypto assets which might trigger tax events or price slippage. Second, borrowers can hedge against market downturn. If the collateral coin price goes down, borrowers may forfeit the collateral instead of repaying the loan, i.e. default. If the price goes up, the borrowers may repay the loan and the accrued interest to regain control of the collateral, i.e. unwind the position. The capped downside and unlimited upside payoff structure makes borrowers’ action contingent to price movements. In addition to hedging, borrowers can leverage their position by chaining up CP2P contracts by repeatedly exchanging the borrowed funds into collateral in the market and borrowing more from the CP2P market. We observe this behaviour from the data we collect from the Ethereum blockchain. 

We study borrowers’ payoff by considering a simple economy, where a borrower possesses one unit of collateral and chains up CP2P contracts. The resulting payoff is exotic: perpetual American roll down call option with exponentially growing strikes and barriers. The payoff can be seen as a variant of the Extended roll-down call option documented in Carr et al. (1999). Other than chaining up contracts by themselves, borrowers may leverage their position using services provided by companies. The “Turbocharge Loans” service provided by company Youhodler can be seen as a securitised version of the CP2P. We delay the complex and lengthy payoff formulas to the upcoming poster. 

The formulation of CP2P payoffs leads us to ask various questions, e.g. what is the current fair value of the contingent claim? How does the price process affect the fair value? Is the current loan parameters reasonable to all parties? Jumps in the crypto price process is particularly in our interest because jumps events are not rare in the crypto world and proven to be significantly impactful on credit products (Chen and Kou, 2009). Given the complexity of the payoff functions and price process, we answer these questions by adapting advanced Monte-Carlo methods, see Glasserman (2004), to double-exponential-jump-diffusion (Kou, 2002).

Hedging Bitcoin with Futures,https://quantinar.com/course/77/Copula,"The introduction of Bitcoin derivatives, specifically the launch of futures contracts on CME in December 2017 and the introduction of cryptocurrency indices such as the CRIX or the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto index, allows investors to hedge Bitcoin risk exposures through futures or contingent claims on indices. We investigate methods for determining an optimal hedge ratio under various dependence structures represented by copulae and using various optimality definitions based on a variety of risk measures.

Because of the volatility swings and price jumps in Bitcoin, the traditional variance-based approach to calculating hedge ratios is impractical. As a result, the techniques can be applied to a variety of risk measures, including Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall and more broadly, Spectral Risk Measures.

Furthermore, we use various copulas to capture the dependency between spot and future returns, such as the Gaussian, Student-t, NIG, and Archimedean copulas.

Tukey's g- and h- transformations,https://quantinar.com/course/144/tukeys-g-and-h-transformations,"In theory, it is often assumed that random variables follow a normal distribution. However, in practice, this is often not the case. ETH returns during the time period from 2015 to the beginning of 2022 are bullish and follow a skewed distribution with heavy tails.

The talk represents our research in which using an adaptive Forward Intensities Approach (FIA), we investigate mutiperiod corporate defaults and other delisting schemes. The proposed approach is fully data-driven and is based on adaptive estimation and the selection of optimal estimation windows. Time-dependent model parameters are determined by a sequential testing procedure. This makes this approach adaptive at every time point. Applying the proposed method to monthly data on 2000 U.S. public firms over a sample period from 1991 to 2011, we estimate default probabilities over various prediction horizons. The prediction performance is evaluated against the global FIA that employs all past observations. For the six months prediction horizon, the local adaptive FIA performs with the same accuracy as the benchmark. The default prediction power is improved for the longer horizon (one to three years). Our method can be applied to any other specifications of forward intensities.",7th November 2022,Kainat Khowaja,3,talk recorded summer camp talk represents research using adaptive forward intensity approach fia investigate mutiperiod corporate default delisting scheme proposed approach fully datadriven based adaptive estimation selection optimal estimation window timedependent model parameter determined sequential testing procedure make approach adaptive every time point applying proposed method monthly data u public firm sample period estimate default probability various prediction horizon prediction performance evaluated global fia employ past observation six month prediction horizon local adaptive fia performs accuracy benchmark default prediction power improved longer horizon one three year method applied specification forward intensity
All about clustering!,https://quantinar.com/course/102/all-about-clustering,"**Cluster analysis** or **clustering** is a set of techniques in the toolbox of unsupervised learning.  The aim of cluster analysis is to categorize the input data, to segment it into homogeneous sub groups that guarantee a simultaneous heterogeneity across the sound subgroups. Cluster analysis is often done in an experimental data analysis framework where one likes to discover structure, e.g. on similar data objects, and where one likes to interpret observations and sub groups based on their relative distances. Cluster analysis may lead in a further step to a discriminant analysis based on labels attached to found subgroups. This course on „all about clustering“ covers several methods on clustering: these include k-means, k-expecttile clustering but also spectral clustering and minimum spanning trees.

This clustering course has several courselets covering spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering, k-expectile clustering and several applications like „understanding jumps in high frequency digital asset markets“. It also introduces into the „financial risk meter for emerging markets“ and covers „dynamic crypto networks“
