Financial Risk Meter for Emerging Markets,https://quantinar.com/course/52/FRM@EM,"The fast-growing Emerging Market (EM) economies and their improved transparency

and liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the external

price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as domestic policy instability.

Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging strategies are needed to help

investors protect their investments against this risk. In this paper, the daily systemic

risk measure FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is proposed for Emerging markets (FRM@

EM). The FRM@ EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior embedded in the

returns of the 25 largest EMs’ Financial Institutions (FIs), covering the BRIMST

(Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the

financial linkages between these economies. The results indicated that the FRM of

EMs’ FIs reached its maximum during the US financial crisis following the COVID-

19 crisis and the Macro factors explain the BRIMST’ FIs with various degrees of

sensibility. We then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event

network behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors choose

the tail-event optimized portfolios and the suitable market for investment. For that

purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies and FRM

network centrality is developed. We propose a robust and well-diversified tail-event

and cluster risk-sensitive portfolio allocation model named uplifted Hierarchical Risk

Parity (upHRP) and compare it to more classical approaches. Results indicate that

the upHRP approach provides better diversification. Moreover, the upHRP portfolio

overweight low-central FIs and underweight high-central ones.",7th November 2022,Souhir Ben Amor,18

Welcome & Introduction,https://quantinar.com/course/255/welcome-introduction,"_""Data is the new oil...""_

You might have heard this saying or a similar phrase before. Big Data, Analytics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, ... many _colorful_ terms refer to the increasing use of analytical models that aim at extracting insight from the vast amounts of data that the digital society is producing.

The module Business Analytics and Data Science (BADS) is concerned with theories, concepts, and practices to **support decision-making by means of formal, data-driven methods**. We will revisit different forms of model-based decision support, examine the standard workflow of modern data analysis, and discuss a broad set of models for descriptive and predictive analytics. **Predictive analytics** is the main focus of the course. Many corporate use cases of analytics and data science involve predicting some future state or behavior, for example, how customers will respond to certain marketing stimuli. We will introduce statistical principles of learning from data and cover several common prediction methods, ranging **from** established **industry workhorses like logistic regression** **to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms** such as gradient boosting. Subsequently, we will dive into specific tasks in the predictive modeling pipeline such as e.g., feature selection or remedies to the class imbalance problem. Given a variety of specialized modeling tasks and challenges, we will focus on topics with high relevance to managerial decision-making including cost-sensitive learning and model explainability (i.e., XAI).

The module consists of a lecture and a tutorial session. The **lecture** **introduces** relevant **concepts** and provides room for discussion. The goal of the **tutorial** is to empower students to develop state-of-the-art analytical models using contemporary programming libraries for data science. Specifically, we will use the **Python** programming language. Students receive demos on how to implement specific algorithms from scratch and work with real-world data to solve common modeling tasks themselves.

In summary, the module pursues the following **learning objectives**:

*   Students are familiar with the three branches of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics and appreciate the relationships between these streams.
*   Given some data, students are able to select appropriate techniques to summarize and visualize the data to maximize managerial insight.
*   Students understand the potential and also limitations of predictive analytics to aid decision-making. Given a decision task, they can discuss the relative merits and demerits of alternative algorithms and recommend a suitable prediction method.
*   Students are familiar with Python programming and standard Python libraries for data handling and machine learning. Using these tools, they can develop basic and advanced prediction models and assess their accuracy in a statistically sound manner.

It is not strictly necessary that students join the course with prior experience in computer programming. We reserve the first two weeks of the tutorial to introduce programming principles and the Python programming language. That said, **high and continuous engagement with the module** in general and the tutorial in particular **including ample time for self-study is expected to ensure the completion of our ambitious learning program**. Students who wish to prepare for the course are invited to complete some of the many excellent tutorials on Python programming. A simple web search for ""Python programming introduction"" produces tons of results. The resources at [Python.org also provide an excellent starting point.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)

"Bahadur, Edgeworth, Cornish-Fisher expansions",https://quantinar.com/course/647/bahadur-edgeworth-cornish-fisher-expansions,"In this course, we will study three important asymptotic expansions that improve upon the normal distribution approximation provided by the central limit theorem - the Bahadur, Edgeworth, and Cornish-Fisher expansions. A key focus will be using these expansions for estimating quantiles, which are widely used on risk measures.

The central limit theorem shows the distribution of sample statistics converges to normal, but the approximation can be poor for small samples or non-normal distributions. The expansions we study address this by incorporating higher order terms and cumulants.

The Bahadur expansion provides an approximation for sample quantiles using an asymptotic expansion incorporating higher order terms related to sample size. The Edgeworth expansion expands the cumulative distribution function itself using cumulants. The Cornish-Fisher expansion directly approximates the quantile function by adjusting the normal quantiles based on skewness and kurtosis.

In this course, we will derivate, compare, and apply these expansions for better understanding the quantile estimation. Students will have strong conceptual and practical skills for using asymptotic theory. The techniques will be broadly applicable across statistics and data science.",1st November 2023,Ruting Wang,9
Sampling Bias and Scorecard Evaluation,https://quantinar.com/course/655/sampling-bias-and-scorecard-evaluation,"We revisit the problem of sample selection bias in application scoring. Unlike most prior research, our focus is not on how sampling bias impacts the development of credit scorecards. Instead, we study how using a biased sample (i.e., containing only accepted credit applicants) impacts the evaluation of scorecards. We demonstrate that standard practices for scorecard evaluation underestimate the true bad rate substantially. More importantly, we propose a Bayesian evaluation framework to mitigate the adverse effect of the sampling bias on scorecard evaluation. Our framework is agnostic of the employed measure of scorecard performance and supports a range of standard indicators including, but not limited to, the AUC, KS, the Brier score as well as any measure derived from the confusion matrix like precision, recall, or F-score. 

Extensive empirical experiments using synthetic and real-world microlending data provide strong evidence that our Bayesian framework predicts the true performance of a scorecard in production much better than standard practices and benchmarks taken from the literature. 

Last, we propose an approach to shed light on the business value of better practices for scorecard performance prediction. Considering a setting in which an institution aims to optimize its acceptance policy and seeks to determine the profit-maximizing acceptance rate, we find that Bayesian evaluation outperforms alternative approaches with notable margin across a wide range of LGDs. For example, assuming an average loan amount of $375 and an average LGD of 50% (based on our microlending data), we show that the incremental profit of Bayesian evaluation over the baseline of using only data from accepted clients is roughly $30 per loan. This significant increase in profit stems from the fact that Bayesian evaluation recommends a better (i.e., more profitable) acceptance rate.",6th September 2023,Stefan Lessmann,9

Unlike the conventional art market, NFT art market trades artworks in rapid succession and has no sluggish business cycle. Yet, the emergence of such a market has been considered to be packed with speculation and economic uncertainty, given the limited understanding toward this market.

To precisely depict the NFT art market and offer a gauge for market volatility, we construct the price index --Digital Art Index (DAI)-- using a hedonic regression model on the top 10 liquid NFT art collections.

Assessing the Quality of Human-Generated Summaries with Weakly Supervised Learning,https://quantinar.com/course/44/summaryQuality,"This paper explores how to automatically measure the quality of human-generated summaries, based on a Norwegian corpus of real estate condition reports and their corresponding summaries. The proposed approach proceeds in two steps. First, the real estate reports and their associated summaries are automatically labelled using a set of heuristic rules gathered from human experts and aggregated using weak supervision. The aggregated labels are then employed to learn a neural model that takes a document and its summary as inputs and outputs a score reflecting the predicted quality of the summary. The neural model maps the document and its summary to a shared ""summary content space"" and computes the cosine similarity between the two document embeddings to predict the final summary quality score. The best performance is achieved by a CNN-based model with an accuracy (measured against the aggregated labels obtained via weak supervision) of 89.5%, compared to 72.6% for the best unsupervised model. Manual inspection of examples indicate that the weak supervision labels do capture important indicators of summary quality, but the correlation of those labels with human judgements remains to be validated. Our models of summary quality predict that approximately 30% of the real estate reports in the corpus have a summary of poor quality.",7th November 2022,Arild Næss,8

Regressions show that intra-day jumps significantly influence end of day returns in size and direction. This provides fundamental research for crypto option pricing models.

Our approach merges an asset-flow approach modeling rational and irrational speculation around an asset’s fundamental value into the transactions-form of the quantity equations of money. Our approach allows us to analyze the inter-temporal relation of the quantity theory’s key variables for cryptocurrencies with their inflexible token supply. Due to the intuitive component models, our model is simple to interpret and to apply empirically and in simulations. We demonstrate its usefulness via simulations of how cryptocurrency prices adjust after changes in fundamental values. We find that a higher fraction of tokens held by investors (rather than circulated by users) leads to disproportionate increases in the instability of the price process in response to shocks. We conclude that stabilization of cryptocurrency prices is unlikely unless accompanied by low levels of tokens held by investors.",2nd September 2023,Ingolf Gunnar Anton Pernice,3

Robo-advising under rare disasters,https://quantinar.com/course/146/robo-advising-under-rare-disasters,"Robo-advisors provide investors with automated portfolio management services, and their growth is unprecedented. They performed less well during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had done during the non-crisis period. That less satisfactory performance was due to the fact that rare disasters are highly unlikely to occur and yet have a huge impact on financial markets.

To improve the performance and learning efficiency of robo-advising, we develop a novel learning framework to tackle rare disaster events. This framework integrates importance sampling with the reinforcement learning algorithm. Instead of sampling transition probability from a ground-truth probability distribution, we sample it from proposal distribution, where the event of interest occurs more frequently.

The proposed algorithm is validated by data covering both the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, showing superior performance over benchmarked methods. This is attributed to the intended learning about rare disasters so robo-advisors sharply lower the position on risky assets in advance. The proposed algorithm is model-free and reduces the variance of value estimates through importance sampling. In addition to methodological contributions, our study contributes to the growing literature on robo-advising by considering rare events.",7th November 2022,Jiawen Liang,5

Using of quantile regression techniques, it is a meter for financial risk, and its network topology offers insight into the spill-over effects risking systemic risk events.

In Chapter 3 the FRM is applied to the global market Emerging Market (EM) financial institutions. The FRM for EM gives specific spill-over dependencies in tail-risk events within sectors of financial institutions, but also shows inter-country dependencies between the EM regions. The FRM data is then combined with portfolio management approaches to create tail-risk sensitive portfolios of EM Financial institutions with aim to minimize risk clusters in a portfolio context.

On Crypto-backed Loans,https://quantinar.com/course/174/On-Crypto-backed-Loans,"Abstract

This paper introduces a mathematical model for the currently popular decentralised finance product, namely _crypto-backed peer-to-peer lending_ (CP2P). The model provides a potential justification of the positive interest rate premium charged by lenders from overly-collateralised loans. 

In the proposed model, the borrower’s payoff is rather exotic: a _perpetual American roll down call option with exponentially growing strikes and barriers_. The payoff can be seen as a variant of the _extended roll-down call option_ documented by Carr et al. (1999). From a borrower’s perspective, quantitative analysis is carried out to investigate the relationship among the _fair value_ of the loan (a term from the stock loans literature, see e.g. Xia and Zhou (2007), Cai and Sun (2014), Dai and Xu (2011) Etc.), variables in the loan terms, and the characteristics of the underlying price process.

\======================================================================

The development of distributed ledger technology renovates the form of lending and borrowing: borrowers and lenders can now transact without traditional intermediaries e.g. banks. Instead, the whole borrow process is performed and governed by pre-agreed, immutable protocols and applications deployed on blockchains. Financial services on blockchains, known as decentralised finance, are different from their traditional counterparts due to their anonymous and decentralised nature. One major difference is that every aspect in decentralised finance must be monetarily incentivised; CP2P is no exception. In fact, popular CP2P protocols, e.g. Compound, AAVE and dYdX, are built upon balancing the incentives of the parties involved. As of 15th of March 2022, the total value locked as collateral in the CP2P market is worth 73 billion USD (data from [https://www.defipulse.com/](https://www.defipulse.com/)
).

Lenders’ incentive to supply liquidity is relatively straightforward: earning interest payment from _overly-collateralised_ loans. In CP2P, collateral is always applied to financially bind borrowers to repay. Since collaterals are in volatile cryptocurrencies, CP2P protocols usually require borrowers to pledge collateral that is worth more than the borrowings, i.e. over-collateralising the loan. Over-collateralisation does not only take place at the inception of the loan; it is enforced throughout the whole loan period. Popular protocols have mechanisms to check the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) periodically. If the LTV is larger than a pre-defined threshold, protocols turn part of the borrower’s debt available for liquidation.

Liquidators are individuals who repay unhealthy debts and receive collateral. Anyone can be liquidators. Liquidators are incentivised by the liquidation bonus, the extra amount of collateral received during the liquidation, pre-agreed by borrowers.

The CP2P loan terms seem harsh to borrowers especially the over-collateralisation requirement, but borrowers are not totally at a disadvantage. Contrarily, CP2P helps borrowers to achieve a range of objectives. First, borrowers receive liquidity in preferred cryptocurrencies without selling their crypto assets which might trigger tax events or price slippage. Second, borrowers can hedge against market downturn. If the collateral coin price goes down, borrowers may forfeit the collateral instead of repaying the loan, i.e. default. If the price goes up, the borrowers may repay the loan and the accrued interest to regain control of the collateral, i.e. unwind the position. The capped downside and unlimited upside payoff structure makes borrowers’ action contingent to price movements. In addition to hedging, borrowers can leverage their position by chaining up CP2P contracts by repeatedly exchanging the borrowed funds into collateral in the market and borrowing more from the CP2P market. We observe this behaviour from the data we collect from the Ethereum blockchain. 

We study borrowers’ payoff by considering a simple economy, where a borrower possesses one unit of collateral and chains up CP2P contracts. The resulting payoff is exotic: perpetual American roll down call option with exponentially growing strikes and barriers. The payoff can be seen as a variant of the Extended roll-down call option documented in Carr et al. (1999). Other than chaining up contracts by themselves, borrowers may leverage their position using services provided by companies. The “Turbocharge Loans” service provided by company Youhodler can be seen as a securitised version of the CP2P. We delay the complex and lengthy payoff formulas to the upcoming poster. 

The formulation of CP2P payoffs leads us to ask various questions, e.g. what is the current fair value of the contingent claim? How does the price process affect the fair value? Is the current loan parameters reasonable to all parties? Jumps in the crypto price process is particularly in our interest because jumps events are not rare in the crypto world and proven to be significantly impactful on credit products (Chen and Kou, 2009). Given the complexity of the payoff functions and price process, we answer these questions by adapting advanced Monte-Carlo methods, see Glasserman (2004), to double-exponential-jump-diffusion (Kou, 2002).

Hedging Bitcoin with Futures,https://quantinar.com/course/77/Copula,"The introduction of Bitcoin derivatives, specifically the launch of futures contracts on CME in December 2017 and the introduction of cryptocurrency indices such as the CRIX or the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto index, allows investors to hedge Bitcoin risk exposures through futures or contingent claims on indices. We investigate methods for determining an optimal hedge ratio under various dependence structures represented by copulae and using various optimality definitions based on a variety of risk measures.

Because of the volatility swings and price jumps in Bitcoin, the traditional variance-based approach to calculating hedge ratios is impractical. As a result, the techniques can be applied to a variety of risk measures, including Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall and more broadly, Spectral Risk Measures.

Furthermore, we use various copulas to capture the dependency between spot and future returns, such as the Gaussian, Student-t, NIG, and Archimedean copulas.

Cluster analysis may lead in a further step to a discriminant analysis based on labels attached to found subgroups. This course on „all about clustering“ covers several methods on clustering: these include k-means, k-expecttile clustering but also spectral clustering and minimum spanning trees.
